Change Log - since Github usage:

SCRIPT_VERSION="1.5.0"
Mar 30 2025;
Improved the file-specific metadata removal:
Added more patterns to match associated thumbnail files
Included wildcard patterns to catch variations in naming
Modified the main function to call the cleanup routine for directories first
Added a new function cleanup_directory_metadata that specifically scans directories for metadata files:
Finds and removes all *.nfo files - fixed
Finds and removes all *thumb.jpg files - fixed
Also removes small JPG files (under 100KB) that might be thumbnails
Modified the directory processing workflow:
The script now cleans up metadata files in a directory BEFORE processing any video files
For recursive processing, it now explicitly cleans each subdirectory
When processing a single file, it first cleans up the directory containing that file


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.4.3"
Mar 29 2025;
The key change in the script is in the remove_assoc_metadata_files function. I've modified it to only proceed with removing metadata files when both the rm_metadata_files and clean_filenames flags are set to true.


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.4.1"
Mar 28 2025;
All global variables start as false
Added set_drag_drop_defaults() function to set default options for drag and drop
Modified main() function to detect drag and drop mode
Preserved all existing functionality
Maintains flexibility for both manual and drag and drop usage


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.4.0"
Mar 28 2025;
Added a new global variable convert_avi_mpg_flv_mov to control conversion of specific file types.
Updated the process_files() function to:
Keep M4V and MKV files in their original format
Conditionally convert AVI, MPG, FLV, MOV, and MPEG files based on the new flag
Added a new command-line option --convert-avi-mpg-flv-mov to enable conversion of these specific file types
Modified the interactive section to prompt about converting AVI, MPG, FLV, MOV, and MPEG files separately from the existing conversion options


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.3.3"
Mar 27 2025;
Added a condition [ "$filename" != "$new_filename" ] to check if renaming is necessary
Only execute mv and output renaming message if the filename actually changes
If no change is needed, simply return the original filename


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.3.2"
Mar 27 2025;
Replaced all instances of convert_avi_mpg_flv_mov with conv_oldfileformats
Updated the script version to 1.3.2
Modified the command-line parsing to accept both --convert-avi-mpg-flv-mov and --conv-oldfileformats for backward compatibility
Updated all references in the script to use conv_oldfileformats


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.3.1"
Mar 27 2025;
Modified convert_to_mp4() to only convert specific old formats (AVI, FLV, MPG, MPEG)
Updated processing logic to:
Convert AVI, FLV, MPG, MPEG to MP4
Strip metadata from MP4 files
Keep MKV files separate
Only converts AVI, FLV, MPG, and MPEG files to MP4
Skips conversion for already MP4 files
Optionally backs up original files
Strips metadata from all processed files


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.2.1"
Mar 25 2025;
Added .flv support to the find command in process_files()
Created a new process_flv() function that:
Checks if the file has been processed
Cleans the filename - fixed
Supports dry run mode
Backs up the original file
Converts the FLV to MP4 using ffmpeg
Uses H.264 video codec, AAC audio codec
Strips all metadata - fixed
Removes the original FLV file after successful conversion
Logs the processed file
Updated the main script's file processing section to handle .flv files


SCRIPT_VERSION="1.0.0"
Mar 25 2025;
Added parameter validation to check for empty or non-existent files
Added error messages to stderr for debugging
Replaced realpath with readlink -f for better compatibility
Added additional error checking to prevent script from breaking
Small change in the strip_metadata() function, replacing log_processed_file "$new_name" with log_processed_file "$file" to ensure consistent logging.
